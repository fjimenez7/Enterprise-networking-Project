The Mls-SW Layer 3 switch is configured as the core switch in the enterprise network, providing inter-VLAN routing, OSPF-based dynamic routing, and redundancy for default routes. 
It acts as the default gateway for multiple VLANs and ensures efficient communication between subnets while relaying DHCP requests to a centralized DHCP server.

Basic Configuration:
Hostname: Mls-SW is set as the hostname.
Service Password Encryption: Passwords are encrypted using (service password-encryption).

SSH Configuration:
SSH version 2 is enabled for secure remote management.
Domain name cisco.net is configured to support SSH key generation.
No IP Domain Lookup: Prevents the device from resolving mistyped commands as domain names.

Spanning-Tree Protocol:
Mode: PVST (Per VLAN Spanning Tree) is enabled. This is useful for VLAN-specific load balancing and loop prevention.

Interface Configurations:
Layer 3 Interfaces (routed ports):
GigabitEthernet1/0/1: 172.16.3.146/30
GigabitEthernet1/0/2: 172.16.3.149/30
These ports are configured as routed ports (no switchport), allowing them to function at Layer 3.

Layer 2 Trunks:
Interfaces GigabitEthernet1/0/3 to GigabitEthernet1/0/8 are set to switchport mode trunk for carrying multiple VLANs between switches.
Unused Ports:
Remaining ports are not configured or disabled, which is good practice for security.

VLAN Interfaces (SVIs):
VLANs are configured with corresponding IP addresses and DHCP relay (ip helper-address) pointing to 172.16.3.130:

VLAN 10: 172.16.1.1/25
VLAN 20: 172.16.1.129/25
VLAN 30: 172.16.2.1/25
VLAN 40: 172.16.2.129/25
VLAN 50: 172.16.3.1/25
VLAN 60: 172.16.3.129/28
Purpose: These SVIs act as the default gateways for their respective VLANs, providing inter-VLAN routing.

Routing Configuration:
OSPF (Process 10):
The Layer 3 switch is participating in OSPF with router-id 2.2.2.2.
Subnets from VLANs and routed interfaces are advertised into OSPF Area 0. This allows routing between VLANs and other network segments.

Static Routes:
Default route through GigabitEthernet1/0/1 (primary) and GigabitEthernet1/0/2 (backup with AD 120). This provides redundancy for external connectivity.

Security Configuration
Local Authentication:
A local username (admin) is configured with encrypted Type 7 passwords.

VTY Lines:
Remote access is secured via SSH (transport input ssh).
Banner MOTD:
A banner message is displayed to warn against unauthorized access.

Summary :
This configuration supports a scalable and secure enterprise network, providing redundancy and inter-VLAN routing while maintaining basic security best practices.
