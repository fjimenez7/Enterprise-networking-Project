Configuration Analysis for CoreR1 Router(similar config for both router are one will be described) 

The CoreR1 router has been configured as a central device within an enterprise network, with a focus on secure management, efficient routing, 
and NAT for internet connectivity. Below is a detailed breakdown of the configuration and its significance:

General Settings
Hostname:
The router is named CoreR1 for easy identification within the network.

Service Password Encryption:
service password-encryption is enabled to encrypt plaintext passwords in the configuration for added security.

Administrative Credentials:
A local username admin with an encrypted password is created for SSH-based management. The enable password is also encrypted.

Domain Name:
The domain name is set to cisco.net, which is required for generating RSA keys for SSH.

Interface Configuration
GigabitEthernet0/0:
IP Address: 172.16.3.154/30
Assigned as an inside NAT interface, connecting to the internal network.

GigabitEthernet0/1:
IP Address: 172.16.3.145/30
Also configured as an inside NAT interface for redundancy or load balancing.

Serial0/2/0:
IP Address: 195.136.17.1/30
Configured as an outside NAT interface, connecting to an ISP for external communication.

Serial0/2/1:
IP Address: 195.136.17.5/30
Configured as a backup ISP connection with a higher administrative distance.

Routing Configuration
OSPF (Open Shortest Path First):

OSPF is configured with Process ID 10 and Router ID 3.3.3.3.
Networks included in Area 0 (Backbone Area):
172.16.3.144/30
172.16.3.152/30
195.136.17.0/30
195.136.17.4/30
log-adjacency-changes tracks OSPF neighbor state changes for monitoring.

Static Routes:
Primary Default Route:
ip route 0.0.0.0 0.0.0.0 Serial0/2/0 (Primary ISP)
Backup Default Route:
ip route 0.0.0.0 0.0.0.0 Serial0/2/1 120 (Backup ISP with higher AD of 120).

NAT Configuration
NAT Overload (PAT):
Inside local traffic (from 172.16.x.x) is translated to the public IP of Serial0/2/1 for internet access.

Access List 1 permits traffic from internal subnets:
Example command: access-list 1 permit 172.16.1.0 0.0.0.127 (you would do this for each internal subnet that needs outsode access)
172.16.1.0/25, 172.16.1.128/25, 172.16.2.0/25, 172.16.2.128/25, etc.

NAT statement:
ip nat inside source list 1 interface Serial0/2/1 overload.

Access Control
Access-List 1:
Permits traffic from specific internal subnets (172.16.x.x) to be translated for NAT.
Security Features
SSH Version 2:

Enabled for secure remote management.
VTY lines configured for local login (login local) and only allow SSH (transport input ssh).
Port Security:
Not explicitly configured in this router but can be assumed to be implemented at the access layer.

Banner:
A Message of the Day (MOTD) banner is configured to warn unauthorized users.

Additional Configurations
Spanning Tree:

The router is configured in PVST mode to prevent Layer 2 loops, though it's more relevant for switches.

Summary:
This router serves as a core router within the network and connects the enterprise LAN to the ISPs for internet access. Key configurations include:

OSPF for dynamic routing.
NAT Overload for internet connectivity.
SSH for secure management.
Static routing for backup ISP connectivity.
Access control using ACLs.
