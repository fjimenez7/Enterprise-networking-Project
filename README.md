Enterprise Network Design and Implementation on Cisco Packet Tracer

This project demonstrates the design and implementation of a scalable and efficient business network using Cisco Packet Tracer. The network was built with a hierarchical architecture, separating the core, distribution, and access layers to enhance performance and scalability while maintaining manageability.

Key features of the project include VLAN segmentation to ensure logical separation of departments and improved security. Inter-VLAN Routing (SVI) was configured to allow seamless communication between VLANs, enhancing functionality and network efficiency. A DHCP server was implemented to automate IP address allocation, reducing manual configurations and the risk of errors.

For security, port-security mechanisms were configured to prevent unauthorized devices from connecting to the network. Secure management of network devices was ensured by enabling SSH, allowing encrypted remote access for administrative purposes. NAT Overload (Port Address Translation) was used to provide internet access to internal devices while conserving public IP addresses. Access Control Lists (ACLs) were applied to restrict and control network traffic, bolstering security by allowing only authorized communication.

The project also included WLAN configuration, setting up wireless access points for seamless connectivity to mobile devices and laptops. Static IPv4 addressing was used in specific cases to provide consistency and support critical devices, while host configurations were implemented to meet the specific requirements of the network.

This project highlights proficiency in designing and configuring key networking technologies such as VLANs, SVI, DHCP, NAT, ACLs, and WLAN, all while ensuring robust security and reliable performance. It serves as a comprehensive demonstration of enterprise network design principles and practical implementation using Cisco Packet Tracer.

The repository contains Packet Tracer files, detailed network documentation, and configuration scripts to provide insight into the network's structure and functionality. This project is a valuable resource for anyone interested in understanding enterprise network design and implementation best practices.
